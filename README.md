World of Warcraft fishing bot ðŸŽ£

<img src="./demo.gif" height="200">

Fishcraft uses pixel recognition and detects when fish is on the hook by checking for movements in the bobber.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine.

Copy [config.yml.sample](config.yml.sample) into config.yml and fill in your desired keybind as string.

```yml
key: "0"
debug: false
```

Start the application and focus your WoW window with the character standing at a fishing spot fully zoomed in (FPV).

For now the World of Warcraft window will need to be focused at all time.

## Pipeline

Things to be added in the future:
- [ ] Have the progam run "unfocused".
- [ ] Add option to sell using a mount / repair bot.
- [ ] Log loot.
- [ ] Attach lure.
